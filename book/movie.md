Structure

Act I — Origins and Obsession

Francis Peck, mid-40s, lives in Brussels. He’s quirky, intense, and deeply sincere.

Flashbacks to his student job selling opera tickets, where he first hears Rossini.

Later, in Saudi Arabia, he meets an Italian tenor and soprano. The soprano introduces him to L’Italiana in Algeri, sparking his obsession.

Present day: Francis sings in a choir with elderly members. He’s trying to convince them to join his opera project.

He’s also part of a “religious, non-religious” discussion group, where he finds inspiration for his Stabat Mater adaptation.

He begins writing a meta-opera about Rossini, starring himself.

Act II — The Madness Builds

Francis uses AI to co-write the opera, generating libretti, scores, and marketing materials.

He reconnects with old opera contacts—some enthusiastic, others baffled.

He casts a large American bass from his discussion group as the Mayor.

Rehearsals are chaotic: missed cues, forgotten lines, tech failures.

Francis insists on authenticity, quoting Rossini and staging scenes in Bruges.

The choir rebels. The soprano disappears. The AI starts generating surreal scenes.

Francis begins to unravel, convinced Rossini is speaking through the algorithm.

Act III — The Premiere and the Miracle

The premiere arrives. Nothing works: lights fail, props collapse, the Mayor gets laryngitis.

Francis steps in to sing Rossini’s part, disastrously.

Just as the audience begins to leave, the choir starts singing—off-script but beautifully.

The soprano returns, improvises a duet with Francis.

The AI glitches and projects Rossini’s face onto the backdrop.

The audience is stunned. Laughter turns to tears.

Francis collapses backstage, whispering, “I failed perfectly.”
